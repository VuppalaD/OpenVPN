1) Install the OpenVPN and the bridge utilities onto the server:
sudo apt-get install openvpn bridge-utils

2) Change your network to use the new interface by modifying your /etc/network/interfaces file. Make sure you back it up first. The file should be changed to look something like this:

Sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

# This file describes the network interfaces available on system
# and how to activate them.
# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# Set up the bridge interface for OpenVPN
auto br0
iface br0 inet static
address 192.168.1.168
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1
bridge_ports eth0
iface eth0 inet manual
up ifconfig $IFACE 0.0.0.0 up
up ip link set $IFACE promisc on
down ip link set $IFACE promisc off
down ifconfig $IFACE down


3) To allow your VPN client to browse the Internet, you will need to enable IPv4 forwarding.
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
Uncomment the line that reads: net.ipv4.ip_forward=1


4) You will need to open a port on your firewall to allow the VPN traffic get to the server. OpenVPN uses ports 1194 by default, so on your router, forward that port (as UDP) to your server running OpenVPN.
Sudo ufw disable	
Sudo service iptables stop

5) Reboot your server and try pinging google.com
